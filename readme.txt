Automatically refresh Human Readable Time Differences

== Description ==

The [Refreshing Human Time Diff](http://petersplugins.com/free-wordpress-plugins/refreshing-human-time-diff/) plugin automatically refreshes Human Readable Time Differences

== Usage ==

If your theme shows the date an article was posted in a human readable time difference - such as e.g. "posted 2 mins ago" - this plugin refreshes the time difference once a minute.

On the one hand this is a nice feature for your visitors - and on the other hand this allows you to use a caching plugin! All human readable time differences are updated immediately on page load. 

You don't have to change anything. Just activate this plugin and forget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work with my theme? =

As long as your plugin uses the WordPress function [human_time_diff()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/human_time_diff/) this plugin will work.

= What about translation? =

This plugin makes use of the translations coming with WordPress used for the [human_time_diff()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/human_time_diff/) function. So there's no extra translation.

= What about different time zones or a wrong time set on the visitors device? =

You don't have to care about. The plugin sends a reference time to the browser which is considered on calculating the time difference.

= Will it work with a caching plugin? =

That's what this plugin originally was made for! All human readable time differences are updated immediately when a page is loaded. Visitors will see only the proper value.

= Will it work with Infinte Scroll? =

Yes, also posts loaded by Ajax are processed.

= Will there be extra server load? =

No, the refreshs are done locally.

= What else is there to know? =

All human readable time differences are updated once immediately on page load to show the proper value for cached pages. After that the values are refreshed once a minute as long as the time difference is less than 2 days.
